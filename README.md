Molecular Ice Spectrum Tool
![](IMG_3167.PNG)

MIST (Molecular Ice Spectrum Tool) is a tool I made so I could try and fit the bending mode of CO2 observed in Class 0 Protostar IRAS 15398-3359 using data from [Yang et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941L..13Y/abstract). I have since generalized the tool so that it can be used for other projects as well.

See `example.ipynb` for information about how to use it.
